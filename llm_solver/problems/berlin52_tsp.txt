Traveling Salesman Problem - Berlin52

I need to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem for 52 cities in Berlin.

PROBLEM:
- Visit all 52 cities exactly once
- Return to the starting city
- Minimize total travel distance

DATA:
- City coordinates are in: brkga/data/berlin52.tsp
- File format:
  * Lines 1-6: Header (NAME, COMMENT, TYPE, DIMENSION, EDGE_WEIGHT_TYPE, NODE_COORD_SECTION)
  * Lines 7+: city_number x_coordinate y_coordinate
  * Example: "1 565.0 575.0"

DISTANCE CALCULATION:
- Use Euclidean distance between cities
- distance(i,j) = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2)

OBJECTIVE:
- Minimize total tour length
- A tour is a permutation of cities [0, 1, 2, ..., 51]
- The decoder should convert BRKGA random keys to a valid tour permutation

SOLUTION FORMAT:
- Tour: [city_0, city_1, city_2, ..., city_51, city_0]
- Total distance: sum of distances between consecutive cities
- The tour should visit each city exactly once

REQUIREMENTS:
- Load city coordinates from the file
- Parse the TSPLIB format
- Calculate pairwise distances
- Use random-key decoder to create tour permutations
- Validate that each city is visited exactly once
